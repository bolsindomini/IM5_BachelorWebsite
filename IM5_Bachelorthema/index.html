            <p>
                I am eager to explore the intersection of film aesthetics and color psychology in my upcoming bachelor thesis. Fascinated by the profound impact of visual elements on storytelling, I aim to investigate how filmmakers strategically utilize color to evoke specific emotions, convey narrative nuances, and shape the overall viewer experience. By delving into the intricate relationship between film looks and color psychology, I hope to gain insights into the deliberate choices directors make in crafting memorable and emotionally resonant cinematic narratives. This exploration will not only contribute to the understanding of visual storytelling techniques but also shed light on the artistry behind the scenes that significantly influences our perception of films.            <!-- Add more paragraphs about color theory -->
